# Connect-Four

A retro grid-based game written in HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.


# Rules of Game

Two players battle it out on a 6X7 grid, trying to connect four of their respective colored checkers/discs in either horizontal, vertical or diagonal directions. 

This is a turn-based game, and so players have the opportunity to block attempts of their opponents creating their connected checkers reaching the required, winning four. 


# How to Play 

To start the game, Press the "Play Button," which unlocks the seven column buttons at the top of the board. Use the column buttons, labelled Col 1 to Col 7 to drop your checker into the desired slot. Once a player has connected four of their checkers either in horizontal, vertical or diagonal directions, the winner is announced and the game resets after three seconds. A "Reset Button" is also available to reset the board and game. 


# Limitations

The game was designed to supplement my online JavaScript learning and is one of the first I have put together. As such, there are some bugs (e.g. a player can still add discs even though the game is over, during the short three-second period before the page is reset). I hope to address these issues in a later version. Styling was not the main focus of the project, hence the basic layout, design and styling.
